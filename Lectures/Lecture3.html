        <p>in the heart of holy see
            In the home of Christianity
            The seat of power is in danger
            There's a foe of a thousand swords
            They've been abandoned by their lords
            Their fall from grace will pave their path, to damnation

        Into the motherland
        The German army march

        In the Soviet Union summer 1943
        Tanks line up in thousands as far the eye can see
        Ready for the onslaught
        Ready for the fight
        Waiting for the axis to march into the trap
        Mines are placed in darkness
        In the cover of the night
        Waiting to be triggered
        When the time is right
        Imminent invasion, imminent attack

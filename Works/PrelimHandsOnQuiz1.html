                <h2>Fort Santiago</h2>
                <h3>Why it's my Favorite</h3>
                <p>Fort Santiago is my favorite place because of its significance in our country's history. 
                   I also like the architecture and its vibes—it feels like taking a step back in history.</p>
                <h3>History of Fort Santiago</h3>
                <p>Fort Santiago is a citadel located in Intramuros, built in 1571 by Miguel López de Legazpi. 
                   Throughout history, it was occupied multiple times by the Spanish, British, Japanese, and Americans. 
                   This is where José Rizal was imprisoned before his execution. Today, it is a historical park.</p>
